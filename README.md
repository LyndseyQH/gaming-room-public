Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

In an effort to reach more customers, social media company Chat Away wants to develop a mobile platform version of their website. This app needs to be distributed in both Android and iPhone app stores. Budget and timeline remain a high priority within the project.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I worked well on the coding and discussed the pros and cons for each OS in a clear and articulate way.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Some amount of research into a project is always beneficial. In other words, describe what each potential direction adds or subtracts to the overall endeavor. I believe the most difficult aspect is knowing when to stop exploring.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would like to expand more on my recommendations and how they relate to this specific project. I would also like to expand on the security aspects. Security has real regulatory repercussions and I’m not sure I adequately verbalized them.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

If you do not address the requirements of your users, they will abandon your application as soon as an alternative becomes available. Furthermore, in order to retain even the most devoted user, it's essential to consistently excite them. For this purpose, I addressed the ability to upload numerous image files and proper memory and storage to limit the flux of quality.
